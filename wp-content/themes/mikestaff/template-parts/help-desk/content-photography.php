			<p>Six weeks prior to the wedding day, couples who have purchased a wedding album will be asked to complete a 
				short, fun design survey .  The results of this survey will let your personal album designer know what style 
				of album you like and the specific photo edits and enhancements that appeal to you.  Our designers will 
				use this information to prepare the first draft of your wedding album.  It is really important for you to 
				take the 10 - 15 minutes necessary to complete this survey, since we cannot begin working on your album before 
				having your directions.</p>

			<p>ALL couples will receive an an email exactly six weeks prior to your wedding containing a Photography 
				Planner.  This guide will be foundational in helping you and your photographer discuss all of the important 
				elements of your day.  Simply have this completed, so when you speak with your photographer a month before 
				your wedding, you’ll be prepared.</p>

			<p class="hd-photo-4week-push hd-icon-wrapper"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-earphone hd-phone"></span> phone call</p>

			<p>Exactly one month before your wedding date, your photographer will contact you to go over your Planner, get 
				familiar with you and to understand your expectations.  This collaborative call will be unrushed and you’ll 
				find that you’ll establish a rapport with your photographer which will result in amazing wedding images. Remember, your final balance is due no later than 30 days prior to your wedding.  You can make payments online at mikestaff.com or you can pay it off in full at any time.</p> 

			<!-- 1 Week Out-->
			<div class="visible-xs text-center hd-mobile-timeline-icon"><img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/help-desk/1-week-out.jpg" /></div>

			<p>Then, the Tuesday before your wedding, your photographer will call you again to confirm all of the final 
				details, timelines and check in to see if you have any last minute questions or concerns.</p>
